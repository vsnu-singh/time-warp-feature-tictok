# time-warp-feature-tictok
Here we will try to implement time warp and water fall feature of tictok in python using cv2 
We will be also implementing 3d video converter to it
for using timewarp you can simply call timewarp(mode,orientation) where mode is "v" for verical and "h" for horizontal orientation is 1 for top down or left to right flow -1 is opposite flow
timewarp() will take default mode as "v" and default orientation as -1, it will return a cv2 image
for using waterfall you can simply call waterfall(mode,orientation) where mode is "v" for verical and "h" for horizontal orientation is 1 for top down or left to right flow -1 is opposite flow
waterfall() will take default mode as "v" and default orientation as -1, it will return a cv2 image
for making 3d video from camera you can call Video_3d() 
press "q" after clicking to video frame to quit
